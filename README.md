# pycti_search_report_by_ioc


opencti Version: 5.3.17

In short, the StixCoreObjectOrStixCoreRelationshipLastReportsQuery is not available in Pycti, although it is documented on the website. At the time of writing, the Pycti documentation was empty, so I hope this can help those who want to use OpenCTI.
